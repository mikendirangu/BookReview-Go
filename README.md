# BookReview-Go

**BookReview&Go** is a simple, single-page web application that allows users to view a list of books, read brief descriptions, and submit their own reviews. The app fetches data from a local JSON database using `json-server` and dynamically updates the content using JavaScript.

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts like asynchronous programming (`fetch` API), DOM manipulation, array methods, event handling, and local development with `json-server`.
